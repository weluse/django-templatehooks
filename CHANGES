ChangeLog
=========

django-templatehooks v0.5.1
---------------------------

Allow multiple endpoints to be specified via the ``@hook`` decorator. For more
details, see the `README
<https://github.com/weluse/django-templatehooks/blob/master/README.rst>`_.

django-templatehooks v0.5
-------------------------

Registering hooks manually is no longer required. The previous behavior caused
more problems than it solved, because you had to strictly control the import
order to get it to work. There is theoretically backwards-incompatible, because
your manual register() calls might override existing hook bindings. In reality
this is a non-issue because in this order the bindings would not have worked in
the first place. For more details, consult the `README
<https://github.com/weluse/django-templatehooks/blob/master/README.rst>`_.
